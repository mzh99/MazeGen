## MazeGen
Maze-Generation Prototype for Windows

Generates rectangular mazes based on user-specified parameters.
Displays an ASCII maze when done.

Also provides geometry output capability for:
1) Maya MEL Script: creates individual walls objects (including reasonable UV projections)
2) WinForms Graphics Drawing: 2d overhead draw using lines

Currently only supports maze generation using Recursive backtracker algorithm.
